# Biography

Welcome!

I am a forth-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Peking University. Currently, I am a visiting student at [NETMIT](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/wordpress/), adviced by [Prof. Dina Katabi](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dina/). Prior to that, I was a research intern in [Megvii (Face++) Inc.](https://megvii.com/) supervised by [Dr. Xiangyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuB-cfoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Mr. Yuning Jiang](https://yuningjiang.github.io/). I was also a research intern at Institute of Computer Science and Technology (ICST), Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com/).

My reserach interests mainly lie in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Now I am working on machine learning application in computer network. Specifically, in Prof. Dina Katabi's Lab, I am now building an intelligent system that can understand wireless signals and achieve through-wall perception.
